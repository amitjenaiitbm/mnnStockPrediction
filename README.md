Abstract: Artificial Neural Network is an efficient tool for non-parametric modelling of data where the output is a non-linear function of the inputs. Stock price prediction is one of the emerging field of the Neural Network forecasting area. Here we present a method to model the Bombay Stock Exchange (price index) data using ANN. Stock Market prediction depends on multiple known and unknown parameters.

Artificial Neural Network is based on the concept of 'Learn by example'. We take the previous available data and train the ANN to adjust the weights. When the ANN is trained it is used for inference. To capture the relationship between the technical indicators and the levels of the index in the market for the period under investigation, a backpropagation network is used.

After studying various features of the ANN model, an optimal model is proposed for the purpose of forecasting. This ANN model can act as decision making tool for investors. Accuracy of the performance of the Neural Network is compared using various out of sample performance measures. The statistical and financial performance of this technique is evaluated using Gradient Descent method and Levenberg-Marquardt method.
